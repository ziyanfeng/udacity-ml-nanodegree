### <a name="project-overview"></a>Project Overview

A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, your task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that you find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. You will need to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.

As education has grown to rely more on technology, vast amounts of data has become available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more, are now captured in real time through learning management systems like **Canvas** and **Edmodo**. This is especially true for online classrooms, which are becoming popular even at the primary and secondary school level. Within all levels of education, there exists a push to help increase the likelihood of student success, without watering down the education or engaging in behaviors that fail to improve the underlying issues. Graduation rates are often the criteria of choice, and educators seek new ways to predict the success and failure of students early enough to stage effective interventions.


### <a name="project-highlights"></a>Project Highlights

This project is designed to let you practice various supervised learning alogrithms using `scikit-learn`. After exploring a few algorithms, you are expected to identify the best model most applicable to the problem.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

- The strengths and weaknesses of various supervised learning algorithms.
- How to explain supervised learning algorithms in layman's terms.
- How to evaluate and compare models’ performance with training time, prediction time and F1 scores.


### <a name="install"></a>Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 


### <a name="code"></a>Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `student_intervention.ipynb` notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.


### <a name="run"></a>Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run the following commands:

```jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
